Our apartment is a fourth floor walk-up in a co-op that was rehabbed by it's owners. It has not been made to feel suburban or generic - it's not a 'luxury apartment'. It's plenty of space, a quiet well-lived-in, well furnished place to relax after a day of pounding the pavement or a night on the town.  It's well lit, with one very large and one small bedroom (our six-year-old sleeps there), a bathroom (shower, no tub) and an open kitchen and living room, all with wood floors, some painted, some stained. The building has been a pillar of the neighborhood for many years, and most folks in the building are invested in keeping the area safe, affordable and diverse.

They are very nice and will be happy to help with questions in navigating the city, however, one works from home so it should be relatively quiet during business hours.
